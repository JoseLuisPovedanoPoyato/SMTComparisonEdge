This application is a benchmark that compares the performance and overhead of a micro-service application when meshed with different Service Mesh Technologies.
This is a novel approach at comparing Service Mesh Technologies as it assess the performance and overhead of the application at different scales.

To build the application go to `src/`, the `readme.md` file there includes the list of requirements and steps to get started.

To view the results from some previous executions navigate to `results/`.
